Code repository for all scripts and data files associated with **Rising temperature non-additively alters how different dimensions of biodiversity affect ecosystem-scale processes** by _S.P. Richards_ (sprich@umich.edu), _M.H.K. Hesselbarth_ (mhk.hesselbarth@gmail.com), and _J.E. Allgeier_ (jeallg@umich.edu). Our study examines how species-specific physiology and resource-acquisition behavior affect primary production as ambient water temperatures change. Code was written and data were collected by S.P Richards.

The repository contains the following folders:
- 01_Scripts:
  - Folder containing scripts necessary to recreate data and figures.
- 02_Data:
  - Folder containing data generated from the experiment.
- 03_Figures:
  - Folder containing figures.
